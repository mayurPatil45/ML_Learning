# Rock vs Mine Prediction using ML Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a machine learning model using logistic regression to classify objects as either rocks or mines. The model is designed to analyze certain features of an object and make predictions based on those features.

## Features

The features used in this project are carefully selected to capture important characteristics of the objects being classified.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome. In this project, logistic regression is utilized to estimate the probability that an object belongs to the "rock" or "mine" class based on the extracted features. The algorithm learns the relationship between the features and the class labels from the training data and uses this information to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Usage

To use the Rock vs Mine Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies.

2. Prepare your data. Ensure that your data is in a suitable format for training the logistic regression model. It should include labeled examples of objects along with their corresponding features.

3. Train the model. Use the provided code or framework to train the logistic regression model on your dataset. Adjust the hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

4. Evaluate the model. Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step helps determine how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

5. Make predictions. Use the trained model to predict the class labels of new, unseen objects. Supply the relevant features as input, and the model will output its predictions.

## Conclusion

The Rock vs Mine Prediction using ML Logistic Regression model provides a valuable tool for classifying objects as rocks or mines based on the given features. By training the model on an appropriate dataset and optimizing its performance, it can be utilized in various real-world applications such as underwater object detection, marine exploration, and naval defense.

By understanding the model's capabilities and limitations, users can make informed decisions about its deployment and further improvements. Experimenting with different features, algorithms, or preprocessing techniques may enhance the model's accuracy and expand its potential applications.
