# Diabetes Prediction using ML Support Vector Machines (SVM) üè•

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict whether a person is diabetic or not. The model analyzes certain features of an individual and makes predictions based on those features.

## Features
The features used in this project are carefully selected to capture important characteristics of the individual being classified. These features includes Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Presure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, body mass index (BMI), Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age and Outcomes.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support Vector Machines is a popular classification algorithm that finds an optimal hyperplane in a high-dimensional feature space to separate different classes. In this project, SVM is utilized to classify whether a person is diabetic or not based on the extracted features. The algorithm learns the relationship between the features and the class labels from the training data and uses this information to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Usage

To use the Rock vs Mine Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies.

2. Prepare your data. Ensure that your data is in a suitable format for training the SVM. It should include labeled examples of objects along with their corresponding features.

3. Train the model. Use the provided code or framework to train the SVM model on your dataset. Adjust the hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

4. Evaluate the model. Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step helps determine how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

5. Make predictions. Use the trained model to predict the class labels of new, unseen objects. Supply the relevant features as input, and the model will output its predictions.

## Conclusion
The Diabetic Prediction model using SVM provides a valuable tool for predicting whether an individual is diabetic or not based on the given features. By training the model on an appropriate dataset and optimizing its performance, it can be utilized in various real-world applications such as healthcare, early disease detection, and personalized treatment plans.
