# Machine Learning Study Repository ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

Welcome to my Machine Learning Study Repository! This repository serves as a collection of my learnings, projects, and resources related to machine learning. Here, I document my progress, share code implementations, and provide valuable insights gained during my study journey.

- Project 1: [Rock Vs Mine Prdiction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction): A regression project aimed at predicting difference between Rock and Mine.
This project aims to classify between as Rock or Mine using Logistic Regression.

- Project 2: [Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction): A regression project aims to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using Support Vector Machines (SVM). It utilizes a dataset with relevant features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure. The trained model can aid in early detection and prevention of diabetes for improved healthcare outcomes.
