# Machine Learning Study Repository 🤖🧠💻

Welcome to my Machine Learning Study Repository! This repository serves as a collection of my learnings, projects, and resources related to machine learning. Here, I document my progress, share code implementations, and provide valuable insights gained during my study journey.

- Project 1: [Rock Vs Mine Prdiction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction): A regression project aimed at predicting difference between Rock and Mine.
This project aims to classify between as Rock and Mine using Logistic Regression.

- Project 2: [Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Diabetes%20Prediction): A regression project aims to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The trained model can aid in the early detection and prevention of diabetes for improved healthcare outcomes.

- Project 3: [Gold Price Prediction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Gold%20Price%20Prediction): A project using Random Forest Regressor to predict gold prices with remarkable accuracy! 💰📈

- Project 4: [Loan Status Prediction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Loan%20Status%20Prediction): A project using Support Vector Machine(SVM) to predict status of loan! 💰

- Project 5: [Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Wine%20Quality%20Prediction): A project using Random Forest Classifier to predict quality of wine! 🍷 

- Project 6: [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/mayurPatil45/ML_Learning/tree/main/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction)

#### Feel free to contribute, and give me any feedback you might have. Happy predicting!😊
